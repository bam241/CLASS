Computer Program Services
Restrictions on the use of programs and data

Authors and their establishments must be consulted if an organisation receiving programs and data intends to use them to provide commercial service to outside users.

Programs and data are provided on the understanding that the agreement of the originating establishment shall be obtained before a service is offered involving sale or use on a fee-paying basis of the program or data set. This restriction applies also to modified versions derived from program copies obtained from the in2p3 Forge.

Transfer of a program or data to a user in a given establishment confers only the right to use the program within that organisation: in particular, copies of programs and data should not be distributed to persons outside their own establishment; users in other centres should contact the development team directly in order to obtain program copies.

Computer programs and data are provided on the understanding that whenever the use of programs, or locally modified versions of them, results in a publication (a journal, conference proceedings, laboratory report, book etc.), the program and its author or laboratory of origin shall be acknowledged in the publication.

To be more specific as to how these restrictions must be interpreted the following should be noted:
the codes users receive from the in2p3 Forge cannot be further distributed, thereby prohibiting the sale of such material, if users modify codes, they must inform the authors. Improved versions may not be sold without users coming to an agreement with the principal authors, users are not permitted to set up the code on a shared computer which allows other users to access the code by paying a royalty for its use, however, there is no objection to expert users within a contract or project with a third party, modelling a problem, interpreting results and recovering the cost of their work and expertise by using a code received from the in2p3 Forge.

DISCLAIMER

Neither the author nor their establishments assumes any liabilities with respect to the use of, or for damage resulting from the use of, any information, method or process disclosed in the distributed material.
