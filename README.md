# CLASS : **C**ore **L**ibrary for **A**dvanced **S**cenario **S**imulation #
CLASS is developed from a **CNRS/IRSN** collaboration started in 2012.
It's an **open source** package of C++ libraries.

CLASS is a **dynamical fuel cycle simulation tool**. It allows to *simulate* 
the evolution of an entire **nuclear reactor fleet** and its associated 
facilities, such as spent fuel pool, fuel fabrication plant, chemical
separation plant, disposal and so on.
CLASS main asset is its ability to include any kind of reactor, either the 
system is innovative or standard. Indeed, the opportunity is given to each 
user to build his own reactor data bases and models. CLASS aims to be a useful
tool for fuel cycle studies involving **Generation IV** reactors transitions as
well as innovative fuel cycles, such as the **Thorium cycle**.
